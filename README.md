This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error: attempting to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The `bug.as` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.as` provides the corrected version. The error typically arises when array length is checked and then used as index without considering the zero-based index of arrays.
